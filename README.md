# Generate-Random-Number
This Python script implements a simple number guessing game. A random number is generated, and the user is prompted to guess it. The script provides feedback on whether the guess is correct and continues to prompt the user until the correct number is guessed.

🧠 Features

Generates a random number using Python’s built-in random module.
Seeded random number generator for reproducibility.
Input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number.
Clear feedback after each guess.
Runs in any Python 3 environment.
🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x
(No external packages required.)
🚀 How to Run

Save the script as guessing_game.py.
Run the script using a terminal or command prompt:
python guessing_game.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the number.
💡 Example Output

Guess the number between 1 and 100:
> 50
Too high! Try again.
> 25
Too low! Try again.
> 37
Correct! You guessed the number!
📌 Notes

The random number generator is seeded to ensure reproducibility. You can change or remove the seed if you want different behavior each time.
The game will keep running until the user guesses the correct number.
